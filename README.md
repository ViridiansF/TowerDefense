## **Goal of the game :**

The objective of this Tower Defense game is to protect your castle from waves of enemies that try to attack it. In order to do it, you can place different towers along the way that have different effects. You will need different type of towers to prevent the power of different type of enemies, that do not have same forces and weaknesses. Your castle has a certain number of health, if you get under mid-life, the king will not be happy, and if the castle dies, you will be jailed ! Otherwise, if you manage to survive all waves, you will be rewarded. To manage your defenses, you have a money count, that will increase if an enemy is killed or decrease if you buy towers and upgrades. The game is structured by different levels (that correspond to a new map) that are structured by waves (that correspond to new enemies). You have a countdown between each wave and level to prepare defenses. If you find the game slow and want to spice it, you can accelerate the speed of the game (up to 4x) by clicking the button on the upper right corner. But if you nedd more time, you can click on pause button and go to the pause menu where you will find the explaination of each tower's effect. You can also manage the sound and check commands on the option menu.

## **Towers :**

There are different type of towers that will help you fight your enemies :
- A classic tower that have a high fire rate, moderate cost and low cost
- A freezing tower that will slow enemies and do little damage, with low cost and gihh fire rate
- A poison tower that will poison enemies and do long-term damage, with low cost and high fire rate
- An explosive tower that will do great damage in a radius, with a high cost and low fire rate
- A shotgun tower that will do HUGE damage in a short range, but with huge cost and low fire rate
